# DictoApp-public
This is version of DictoApp 0.6 for public use. Some features may work incorrectly, sorry.

This is the first project by group of developers from Lomonosov Moscow State University called Nuclear Energy.

This app serves as a GUI for learning German. We called this app DictoApp. It is fully open-source and we are happy to add as many features as possible so feel free to e-mail us.
